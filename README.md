# OptiTraffic AI: Traffic Signal Prediction System

A next-generation urban traffic control platform that leverages both microservices and SOAP SOA architectures. OptiTraffic AI dynamically predicts and optimizes traffic signals using real-time simulation, machine learning, and secure, scalable service communication. The project includes a live simulation frontend, robust backend services, and a comparative implementation of RESTful microservices and SOAP XML web services.

## Project Overview

OptiTraffic AI is an intelligent traffic signal prediction and control system designed to address urban congestion using a dual-architecture approach:

- **Microservices Pattern:** Modern, containerized RESTful services with JWT authentication, Kafka messaging, and independent deployment.
- **SOAP SOA Pattern:** Enterprise-grade, WSDL-defined SOAP services with WS-Security, XML encryption, and contract-first design.

The system ingests real-time traffic data from a CityFlow simulation, processes it securely, predicts optimal signal phases using an LSTM neural network, and provides live monitoring and notifications through a web dashboard.

## Why OptiTraffic AI?

- **Urban Mobility Optimization:** Reduces congestion, fuel waste, and emissions by dynamically adapting traffic signals.
- **Enterprise-Ready Design:** Demonstrates both cloud-native microservices and legacy-compatible SOAP SOA for real-world integration.
- **Security & Scalability:** Implements end-to-end encryption, robust authentication, and scalable service orchestration.
- **Educational Value:** Offers a hands-on comparison of two major architectural paradigms in a complex, data-driven application.

## System Architecture

### Microservices Architecture

- **API Gateway:** NGINX-based, handles JWT validation, routing, and rate limiting.
- **Services:** Independent containers for login, simulation, prediction, monitoring, and notification.
- **Messaging:** Apache Kafka for asynchronous, decoupled event streaming.
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens for secure, stateless access.
- **Frontend:** React dashboard with live updates via REST and WebSocket.

### SOAP SOA Architecture

- **Service Contracts:** WSDL-defined interfaces for login, prediction, monitoring, and notification.
- **Security:** WS-Security with XML encryption and UsernameToken authentication.
- **Integration:** Centralized service bus for message routing and validation.
- **Frontend:** React dashboard (SOAP backend only; live streaming not supported).

## Key Features

- **Dual Deployment:** Both microservices and SOAP SOA implementations for all core services.
- **Real-Time Simulation:** CityFlow-based traffic simulation with live vehicle and signal data.
- **Secure Data Pipeline:** Fernet (AES-256) encryption for all Kafka messages.
- **AI Signal Prediction:** LSTM neural network predicts optimal green light phases.
- **Live Dashboard:** Frontend displays intersection state, vehicle flow, and analytics.
- **Notification System:** Automated alerts for congestion, accidents, and light failures.
- **Concurrent Authentication:** Multithreaded login service supports high concurrency.

## Microservices vs. SOAP SOA: Major Differences

| Aspect                | Microservices                                   | SOAP SOA                                         |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**             | Application-level, fine-grained services        | Enterprise-level, coarse-grained reusable services|
| **Communication**     | REST/JSON over HTTP, WebSocket, Kafka           | SOAP/XML over HTTP, WSDL contracts, ESB          |
| **Security**          | JWT, HTTPS, Fernet encryption                   | WS-Security, XML encryption, UsernameToken        |
| **Deployment**        | Independent containers, easy scaling            | Centralized, often monolithic deployment          |
| **Data Management**   | Each service manages its own data               | Shared data storage, centralized governance       |
| **Streaming Support** | Native WebSocket for live data                  | Not supported (SOAP is request/response only)     |
| **Frontend Integration** | Real-time updates via WebSocket/REST         | No real-time streaming; polling only              |

## Simulation & WebSocket Streaming

**Live Data Streaming with WebSocket:**
- The simulation service streams live vehicle and signal data to the frontend using WebSocket, enabling real-time visualization of traffic flow and signal changes.
- **Why SOAP XML Could Not Be Used:**  
  SOAP is fundamentally a request-response protocol designed for stateless, synchronous operations. It does not support persistent, bidirectional connections required for real-time streaming. WebSocket, on the other hand, enables full-duplex communication, allowing the server to push updates to the client instantlyâ€”essential for live simulation. This architectural limitation is why WebSocket was used for the simulation service, while SOAP was applied to other backend services.

## How It Works

1. **Simulation:** CityFlow generates realistic traffic patterns and vehicle data.
2. **Secure Messaging:** Data is encrypted and published to Kafka topics.
3. **Prediction:** The LSTM model predicts the optimal green light based on recent traffic snapshots.
4. **Monitoring:** The monitoring service aggregates analytics and exposes them via REST (microservices) or SOAP (SOA).
5. **Notification:** Events like congestion or accidents trigger notifications and emails.
6. **Frontend:** The React dashboard displays live intersection state, analytics, and notifications. In microservices mode, it receives live updates via WebSocket; in SOAP mode, it polls for updates.

## Setup & Deployment

### Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js (for frontend)**
- **CityFlow traffic simulator**
- **Kafka & Zookeeper (managed by Docker Compose)**

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/optitraffic-ai-dual-architecture.git
   cd optitraffic-ai-dual-architecture
   ```

2. **Build & Start Services**
   - For microservices:
     ```bash
     cd [MICROSERVICES]/docker
     docker-compose up --build
     ```
   - For SOAP SOA:
     ```bash
     cd [SOAP XML]/docker
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

   > **Note:** The frontend service is automatically built and started by Docker Compose using its Dockerfile. There is no need to manually run `npm install` or `npm start` in the frontend directory.

3. **Simulation**
   - The simulation service will start automatically via Docker Compose and begin streaming data.

4. **Configuration**
   - Environment variables for encryption keys, JWT, and email credentials are set in the Docker Compose files and `.env` files as needed.
