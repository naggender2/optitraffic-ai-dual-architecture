# optitraffic-ai-dual-architecture
A dual-architecture intelligent traffic signal prediction system that demonstrates both modern microservices and traditional SOAP-based SOA patterns. Features real-time traffic simulation, secure data pipelines, LSTM-based signal prediction. This project showcases the strengths and trade-offs of microservices and SOAP in a real-world scenario.
